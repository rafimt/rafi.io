This study investigates the **factors affecting transportation mode choice and commuter satisfaction** in Rajshahi City, Bangladeshâ€”particularly focusing on suburban commuters traveling into the city. Using a questionnaire survey and analyzing responses through Excel and SPSS, the research identifies key **socioeconomic and travel-related variables** that influence commuter behavior.

## Key Findings:
* **Income, age, travel time, and distance** are the most influential factors affecting mode choice.
* **Bus** is the most commonly used mode, followed by **bicycles** and **CNG/auto-rickshaws**.
* Lower-income commuters prefer buses and bicycles due to affordability, while higher-income individuals lean toward autos.
* **Satisfaction levels** with bus services are moderate but can be improved with better seating, less crowding, improved ventilation, and more frequent, timely service.
* The study uses **Likert-scale evaluations** to assess satisfaction across 22 factors, showing overall satisfaction just below "moderate."

## Implications:
The results offer guidance for **transportation planners and policymakers**: enhancing public transport infrastructure and services could significantly improve commuter satisfaction and efficiency in Rajshahi's growing urban landscape.

## Methodology:
- **Data Collection**: Questionnaire survey targeting suburban commuters
- **Analysis Tools**: Excel and SPSS for statistical analysis
- **Evaluation Method**: Likert-scale assessment across 22 satisfaction factors
- **Study Area**: Rajshahi City, Bangladesh
