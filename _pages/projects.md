## Data Science / Machine Learning

### Wildfire Analysis
This project provides a complete framework for analyzing wildfire data with focus on temporal patterns, geographical distributions, fire size analysis, and correlations between various wildfire characteristics. The analysis is specifically designed for 2022 wildfire data but can be adapted for multi-year datasets.

**Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Output:** Statistical analysis reports  
**GitHub:** [View Repository](https://github.com/rafimt/Wildfire_Analysis_2022)

## Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

### Deforestation Monitoring
This project analyzes deforestation patterns in the Llanos del Yari-Yaguara II Indigenous Reserve in Colombia over a 10-year period (2016-2025) using satellite imagery and vegetation indices. The study focuses on understanding vegetation changes and identifying deforestation patterns to support informed decision-making in forest management.

**Tools Used:** QGIS, Google Earth Engine, matplotlib/seaborn, numpy, QGIS, Jupyter Notebooks  
**Output:** Deforestation maps, temporal analysis, before-after comparison, seasonal variation and land cover change  
**GitHub:** [View Repository](https://github.com/rafimt/Deforestation-Analysis)

### Cycling Coverage Assessment
Spatial analysis of cycling network accessibility in Berlin, identifying gaps between high population density areas and cycling infrastructure coverage.

**Tools Used:** Python, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Contextily  
**Output:** Population density maps, accessibility gap identification, and cycling coverage analysis  
**GitHub:** [View Repository](https://github.com/rafimt/Maps/blob/main/notebook/continent.ipynb)

## Academic Research

### Project Geoinformatics
This project analyzes Land Surface Temperature (LST) patterns using Google Earth Engine (GEE). It focuses on understanding the relationship between urban land use/land cover changes and their impacts on surface temperature variations.

**Tools Used:** Python, Google Earth Engine, geemap, matplotlib/seaborn, numpy, QGIS, contextily, Jupyter Notebooks  
**Output:** Calculation of various spectral indices (NDVI, NDBI, NDWI), temporal LST changes, correlation analysis between LST and land cover types, LST patterns and thermal variations  
**GitHub:** [View Repository](https://github.com/rafimt/Project-Geoinformatics-2024)

## Web GIS Development

### First GeoDjango Map Application
Interactive web mapping application built using Django's geographic framework for spatial data visualization.

**Tools Used:** Django, GeoDjango, GDAL, Leaflet.js, HTML/CSS  
**Output:** Responsive web application with interactive mapping capabilities  
**GitHub:** [View Repository](https://github.com/rafimt/first_geodjango_project)

## Python Automation

### Geocoding Application
A Python GUI application that converts German addresses from Excel files into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) using the Nominatim geocoding service.

**Tools Used:** Python, Geocoding APIs, Pandas, Tkinter  
**Output:** Desktop/web application with batch geocoding functionality and data export features
