# My Projects Portfolio

## Data Science / Machine Learning

### Wildfire Analysis
This project provides a complete framework for analyzing wildfire data with focus on temporal patterns, geographical distributions, fire size analysis, and correlations between various wildfire characteristics. The analysis is specifically designed for 2022 wildfire data but can be adapted for multi-year datasets.

**Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Output:** Statistical analysis reports  
**GitHub:** [View Repository](https://github.com/ rafimt/ Wildfire_Analysis_2022 )
